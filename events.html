          <h6 class="event-title">Workshop on Flutter</h6>
          <p class="event-content">A two-day Flutter workshop was conducted at Mar Ivanios College by the department of
            Computer Science in
            association with ICFOSS on February 29 and March 1, 2024, tailored for S4 Computer Science students to
            enhance their mobile application development skills. The workshop, led by Mr. K S Abhishek, a dedicated
            Flutter Developer, commenced with an introductory speech by Flickson J, expressing excitement to welcome Mr.
            Abhishek and highlighting his expertise in crafting exceptional user experiences. Mr. Abhishek's sessions
            covered a range of topics, including setting up a Flutter project, Dart programming basics, and advanced
            options in VSCode for Flutter development. His hands-on approach, where he personally assisted each
            participant and addressed their queries, was highly appreciated. The workshop, held at the Computer Science
            Department Lab, provided a conducive environment for collaborative learning, enabling participants to engage
            in practical exercises and exchange ideas. The event's success was attributed to Mr. Abhishek's exceptional
            training, the faculty's support, and the enthusiastic participation of the students. The vote of thanks was
            delivered by Hanan Faiza N, who expressed gratitude to Mr. Abhishek, the faculty, and the participants for
            making the workshop a memorable and enriching experience.
